            <h2>Hello,
                I am Agata and I just start my journey with Programming.</h2>
                <p>I come from Poland, where I was studing International Relations and working als Manager in a Dance School.</p>
                <p> I am living in Germany, where I would like to "write" a new chapter of my life. 
Actuall I am a student on DCI (Digital Carrere Institute), where I take first steps in IT branche, here I learn new skills witch can help me to be a good Webdesigner.
I have  this Idea, that till my 35th Birthday I would start working als Webdeveloper.</p>

<p>Free time I love to spend with my family and friends. To do something creativ together (sometimes we are cooking, another time we learn something new, for example: german or spanisch language or even exercising together- yoga).  
I also leave some of the time to spend it with me, myself an I. In this moments I like to:
read a book, do some work in garden or even go all be myself for an adventure, the last one was a Vacation on Cuba. All of it is like a balm for my Soul.</p>
